Hi, uhh, I'm Gloria.

I'm some random lady on the internet™️ and I do some hobbyist software engineering sometimes  
I'm working on a video game engine at the moment, sometimes I contribute to projects I like™️

I mainly do C or C++ ~~(however screw exceptions and most templates)~~ stuff, also I wish me and Rust would get along honestly
