Hi, I'm Gloria!  
I'm a hobbyist software engineer with some years of experience and a thing for the insane and ludicrous :)

Right now I spend most of my time working on Cell, sometimes I contribute to projects I like™️

I work mostly on stuff with Swift, C++ and Rust, but I've also made plenty of experience with C, C#, Go, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript and a couple other programming languages
As long as it catches my interest, I'll give it a shot : )

anyway uh have [cool funky icons](https://skillicons.dev)
