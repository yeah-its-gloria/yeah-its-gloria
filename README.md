Hi, I'm Gloria!  
I'm a hobbyist software engineer with some years of experience and a thing for the insane and ludicrous.  
I work mostly on stuff with Swift, Rust and occasionally C/C++, but I've also made plenty of experience with C#, Go, Java/Kotlin, JavaScript and a couple other programming languages.  
As long as it catches my interest, I'll give it a shot!
