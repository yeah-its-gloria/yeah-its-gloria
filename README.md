Hi, I'm Gloria!  
I'm a hobbyist software engineer with some years of experience and a thing for the insane and ludicrous :)

Right now I spend most of my time working on Cell, sometimes I contribute to projects I like™️

I do C++ and Rust stuff generally :3  
I'm kinda a jack of all trades and can work with a lot of things  
I've made past experiences with C#, Go, Java, you name it! If it's somehow interesting you can bet I'll at least take a look

anyway uh have [cool funky icons](https://skillicons.dev)
